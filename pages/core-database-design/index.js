                    Data should be durable and recoverable in case of system
                    crash
                  </li>
                  <li>DB should support transaction</li>
                  <li>Key arrangement should be sorted and hashed</li>

                  <li>Performance of DB should be very high</li>
                  <li>DB should run in devices to big servers</li>
                  <li>DB should be persistent and in-memory</li>
                  <li>
                    DB should retain performance even when data overflows the
                    working memory size
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    DB should manage itself and do housekeeping as required
                    without admin
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Basic data handling</h2>
                <p>
                  BangDB core implements its own buffer pool where it maintains
                  the pages for index and data files. The buffer pool is
                  basically a hash table with linked nodes. It also contains
                  several other lists such as lru list, dirty page list,
                  prefetch list etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is another list, free list which maintains the free
                  pages. The buffer pool can be private and created for each
                  table or could be shared (default) whereas the free list is
                  per database
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having own buffer pool, allows db to treat different pages in
                  the db differently. This gives the db an edge over simply
                  relying on OS pool as that would not apply the local
                  contextual information for page flush or fetch algorithm.
                  Whereas BangDB can leverage these data and apply them in
                  having better suitable adaptive sequential page prefetch and
                  flush algorithm
                </p>
                <p>
                  Few basic components of the overall page, IO, memory
                  management components are discussed below.
                </p>
                <h2>Data durability and log</h2>
                <p>
                  BangDB implements write ahead log. Basically all the changes
                  to data and index files are written only after the log is
                  written. The logging is available as part of one of the
                  configuration parameters and user can set it on/off as
                  required. But once set for a table, the log will remain in
                  same position (on/off) for all its life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Write Ahead Log (WAL) is always sequential and multiple
                  sequential logs file are being generated in the life of the
                  db. BangDB tweaks the basic design and algorithm for write
                  ahead logging in order to reduce the amount of data to be
                  logged and thereby improving performance without sacrificing
                  on the core basis and benefits of the write ahead logging. It
                  uses modified ARIES algorithm to implement the wal. The
                  modification is basically to optimise the log-size/data-size
                  ratio to improve the performance.
                </p>
                <p>Following are the benefits of Write Ahead Log (WAL) :</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reduces the number of seeks</strong>- since log is
                    always sequential, hence improves IO and performance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Checkpointing</strong>- faster to recover in case of
                    data recovery, can be switched on/off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Crash recovery</strong>- DB can recover from any
                    crash and bring the database to a consistent state (state at
                    the time of crash).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Durability</strong>- Since logs are written before
                    the actual commit of data or index file changes along with
                    data recovery mechanism, the data durability is not
                    dependent upon the write to data or index files.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Transaction</strong> - Write Ahead Logging is the
                    standard approach for transactional logging.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Write Ahead Log (WAL) can be used in following manner:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Shared Log</li>
                  <li>Private Log</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The shared or private are w.r.t table. For example if shared
                  log is used (default way) the all tables will share the log.
                  It helps optimise the IO, however there are certain cases
                  where separate log is required for table and in that case
                  private log comes handy as it creates separate log file for
                  the table. Table which is very often used or high in data
                  volume etc.. are few cases where private log may make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The BangDB implements write ahead log, the ARIES algorithm,
                  for data durability and atomicity. The db always writes a log
                  for every write operation even though it doesn&apos;t persist
                  the actual data to the disk. Since db performs all its
                  operations from the buffer pool and doesn&apos;t go to the
                  disk at all if not needed that means all the data written in
                  the buffer pool can vanish if the process is killed and data
                  can be lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Writing log for all data modification operation ensures that
                  the all operation log is maintained and frequent flushing of
                  the log to disk ensures that the data can be recovered from
                  the log if required. The write ahead log provides the data
                  recovering capability when required. For example in the event
                  of process or machine crash etcâ€¦, BangDB recovers the data
                  when restarted and brings the db to the state where it was
                  when it crashed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The log is sequential and it&apos;s flushed to the disk by the
                  background workers frequently. The user can set the frequency
                  based on the need, higher frequency means data loss would be
                  minimal in case of any eventuality. BangDB provides the flush
                  frequency knob with impressive Milli sec (theoretically can be
                  in micro sec) as the least count. The default frequency is
                  50ms and db performs very good even at this frequency.
                </p>
                <h2>In-memory persistent</h2>
                <p>
                  BangDB is designed to run in persistent or in-memory mode. By
                  default it runs in persistent mode and log may be switched ON
                  or OFF as per configuration. By default log is always ON.
                  However, there are scenarios where in-memory could be best,
                  For example: cache.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But in majority of the cases, persistent mode is best
                  suitable. When db is run in in-memory mode then log is
                  switched off, transaction can&apos;t be ON and it works within
                  the allocated memory budget. Whereas when it runs in
                  persistent mode with log ON, then it can go beyond working
                  memory set and still remain performant. BangDB implements IO
                  Layer and mechanism to reduce the disk IO especially random IO
                  to maximise the throughput.

                <h2>IOPS Performance</h2>
                <p>
                  BangDB gives very high performance and it&apos;s designed for
                  the same. Read and write both are fully concurrent and hence
                  it leverages the available resources on the machine to fullest
                  of its capacity. Also, it implements IO Layer which
                  intelligently keeps track of several data structures and takes
                  right decision or predict best next steps when it comes to
                  minimising IO for higher performance.
