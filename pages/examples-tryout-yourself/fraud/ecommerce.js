          <p>
            Ecommerce fraud is when a fraudster commits a crime via an online
            store by manipulating the transaction process using stolen or
            scammed credit card information to illegally obtain the product or
            payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            An online store is naturally vulnerable to ecommerce fraud since
            transactions occur without the user being in direct contact,
            therefore allowing more opportunities for fraudulent activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the ecommerce fraud involves &quot;reshipping scam&quot;.The
            reshipping scam, which involves fraudsters who use stolen credit
            cards to buy items—usually expensive items—online. Instead of having
            the items shipped to the billing address, the fraudster sends them
            to what&apos;s called a &quot;re-shipper&quot;. At the
            &quot;re-shipper&quot; location, the items are repackaged and
            usually sent overseas. There, they can often be sold at a high price
            on the black market.
          </p>
          <h2>Scenario</h2>
          <p>
            The scam begins when criminals buy high-dollar merchandise - such as
            computers, cameras, and other electronics - via the Internet using
            stolen credit cards. They have the merchandise shipped to addresses
            in the United States of paid &quot;reshippers&quot; (who may be
            unaware they are handling stolen goods). The reshippers repackage
            the merchandise and mail it to locations in Russia, Ukraine,
            Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, and Germany. It works like this :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The criminals steal credit cards information</li>
            <li>They buy goods on ecommerce websites</li>
            <li>The goods are sent to a third party</li>
            <li>
              The third party receives the goods and re-ships them to the
              criminal
            </li>
            <li>The criminal sells the goods and receives cash</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The third party, recruited via a job and promising a generous
            compensation, acts as mule.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            We can model the data the insurance company has about its accidents
            There are a couple of things we can do with that data to identify
            fraud. A first step might be to compare the billing and shipping
            address. A difference between a billing and a shipping address might
            be indicative of a reshipping scam. Furthermore we can look into the
            IP address. If the IP address localization does not match the
            billing address or the shipping address, the situation is highly
            suspicious.

          <h3>Graph Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The graph data model below represents how the data is linked, and
            illustrates how one can find rings by simply walking the graph.
