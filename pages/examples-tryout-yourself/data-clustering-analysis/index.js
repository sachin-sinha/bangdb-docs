          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            This case requires developing a customer segmentation to define
            marketing strategy. The Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of
            about 14360 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The
            file is at a customer level with 18 behavioural variables.

          <h2>Algorithm</h2>
          <p>
            The given problem is a regression problem. To solve it, we will be
            using the Support Vector Regression algorithm (SVR). The advantage
            of SVR over linear regression is that SVR gives us the flexibility
            to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an
            appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the
            data.
          </p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            There are three ways to train a model on bangdb. One is to directly
            register the meta_data for training (we call it json request which
            contains all the details about the model), the second is to create
            mage_data for training by following the workflow on CLI and the
            third is by using APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we will be training the model using all methods. On bangdb, we
            have the option of training a model from a file( file format can be
            CSV or JSON) containing training data or from streaming data. Here
            we are training the model from a CSV file.
          </p>
          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>Using CLI workflow.</p>
