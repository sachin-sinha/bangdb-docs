                  BangDB is a converged multi-model and multi-flavor database
                  platform for building modern applications which require to
                  handle different kinds of data and requirements in a single
                  space. BangDB have been created from ground up, written from
                  scratch to align with the data trend fully and make it ready
                  for the future needs as well. Some of the key design goals of
                  the database were following before the development phase.
                </p>
                <h2>Key design goals</h2>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Store, query, link, join different kinds of data in the same

                  <li>
                    Graph should be linked with the different aspect of the data
                    processing to leverage context.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    AI should be integrated with data such that the implicit and
                    autoML is part of the operation.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <li>
                    Database should be deployed within micro-processors,
                    commodity hardware or in the cloud.

                  <li>

                <p>
                  The above goals quite comprehensive and required a fresh
                  thought, innovative approach and shift in the way NoSQL&apos;s
                  were designed and implemented.
                </p>

                <h2>Need for convergence</h2>
                <p>
                  It becomes obvious from the problem descriptions and
                  challenges that the problem space, due to the current data
                  trend, is converging too many requirements in the singular
                  space. For example, dealing with multiple kinds of data,
                  stream processing with graph linking and storage, AI as part
                  of query and etl etc. Therefore, to counter this convergence
                  at the problem space, we must also converge at the solution
                  level. And if we can do this, then it will straight forward
                  task to deal with the emerging and current use cases properly.
                </p>

                      Problem space has a convergence of the varied requirements
                      at the core.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We must converge the solution space to counter the same.

                      Converge at system level, data level, deployment level.
                      Converge to create a unit of compute which scales
                      linearly.

                <h2>Architectural shift</h2>

                <p>
                  The most important decision was to move away from traditional
                  3-tier or n-tier model towards creating a unit of compute by
                  converging the elements and let that unit of compute scale
                  linearly. One of the biggest issues with the model where we
                  split the system into multiple parts and distribute those
                  parts over the network. Finally combine the results to throw
                  the output to the client.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is typical micro-service-oriented approach, which doesn't
                  fit well with a system like this. This has several issues
                  which are discussed above in detail. But apart from the
                  mentioned issues like it's a costly affair, resource intensive
                  approach, takes too much time to build and ship, app layer
                  becomes brittle leading to huge loss of team's productivity
                  etc., there are core issues as well with this approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Siloed (semi-siloed) architecture forces too many network hops
                  along with too many copies of data.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Same data gets copied multiple times within and across
                      silos.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Several network hops across the layers to process a single
                      event/data.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  With this siloed approach, the performance takes beating,
                  efficiency goes down, network bandwidth reduces, and overall
                  cost also goes up.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                  With convergence, we avoid these issues as well. Once data
                  reaches a node, all computations happen there. This also
                  allows us to handle way more client's request for the same
                  configuration, which reduces cost, complexity and improves
                  performance. Managing such converged system is easy, and it
                  doesn't even require a dedicated set of resources for the
                  same.
                </p>

                <h2>Event Driven (SEDA)</h2>

                <p>
                  Staged Event Driven Architecture (SEDA) is at the core to meet
                  big part of the architectural constraint. Basically, we deal
                  with FSM (finite state machine), within the unit of compute
                  for managing the sub systems with boundaries. The entire
                  structuring of the stages within the node is also
                  configurable. We can create different structures for stages
                  and how they would work together base don requirements. Even
                  the worker level details are configurable. Which means each
                  node, types could be configured for our need. BangDB
                  pre-configures all these which works best in most of the
                  cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are more than 100 configurations that could be tweaked
                  as needed. But 80-90% are not required to be changed most of
                  the times as they work best in most of regular cases.
                </p>

                <h2>Deployment flavors</h2>

                <p>
                  BangDB comes in different flavors in which it could be
                  deployed or used. BangDB can be deployed within a
                  micro-processor. This is required from IOT perspective. To
                  truly manage edge computing, the system should be within
                  devices as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then BangDB cluster can be deployed in client/server models
                  for majority of the use case with replicas attached. BangDB
                  can be distributed further by creating a unit cluster
                  consisting of Core database, training, resource server and
                  user service. This suits most of the use cases and
                  requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, BangDB can be deployed in P2P mode as well, where
                  there is no master or slave. This is auto managed distributed
                  ring where node joins or leaves at will, where distribution is
                  managed on its own. BangDB is going to launch this version by
                  Sep 2024. More on this when we launch.
                </p>
