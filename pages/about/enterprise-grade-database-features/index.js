                  BangDB is enterprise grade database both from implementation
                  and architectural perspective. It is written and created for
                  enterprise level use cases, requirements and need. BangDB is
                  designed with the security, data governance, business
                  continuity, scale, performance, cloud readiness etc. at the
                  center of the goals.

                  Data Resiliency
                </p>

                <p>
                  BangDB is a robust database but at the same time simple at the
                  core level, which allows it to offer several must have
                  enterprise grade features without any compromise or overhead.
                  Following points highlights the key areas in this regard for
                  BangDB.

                  <li>
                    BangDB Cluster may start with 3 and then scale horizontally
                    by adding more machines/vms.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The database is replicated [ could be across DC/ Cloud]
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We can have 1 to 3 replica per node, each could be for
                    configured for read/write.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    BangDB works with auto failover, which maintains operation
                    continuity without business disruption.

                <h2>Data Quality, Governance</h2>

                <p>
                  Maintaining the data integrity and quality when we perform so
                  many different actions on the data, should not be left to the
                  users and their applications. The database should provide
                  enough constructs and means to ensure this in automated
                  manner, without any intervention from the user. But at the
                  same time, users should also have means to configure things to
                  ensure these are aligned per their need. Following are key
                  points that BangDB ensures for ensuring the data governance.
                </p>

                <ul>

                    Profiling and summarizing data for enhancement and policies
                  </li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Security</h2>

                <p>
                  BangDB is implements enterprise grade security with BangDB. In
                  fact, security is not an afterthought for BangDB but one of
                  the basic initial goals of the system. Therefore, it runs
                  continuously and natively within BangDB.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    All access need to be authenticated by the user service
                    using API Key
                  </li>
                  <li>User access is protected using id/pwd for login.</li>
                  <li>
                    Short lived tokens (apart from API key) are used to further
                    add to the security for admin jobs
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    encryption of data over wire.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Data is stored in binary format within BangDB. Which means
                    these files can&apos;t be read.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Data/ fields could be obfuscated based on input map by the
                    user.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The servers are hardened for any random attack over the
