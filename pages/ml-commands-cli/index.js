                  BangDB has ML natively integrated within it. What it means is
                  that ML is part of the system and it does perform work both in
                  implicit and explicit manner. This means that within BangDB we
                  have ML related support for training, testing, versioning,
                  storing and deploying the models for prediction in continuous
                  or other manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While BangDB implements and support certain algorithm
                  implement in c/c+ natively, it also allows users to bring
                  their model, framework or code to run as part of the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Users may leverage some of the frameworks like Tensorflow,
                  PyTorch etc. as they like or require. Since one of the major
                  problems with ML is dealing with large files, either
                  training/test files or models themselves, therefore BangDB
                  uses BRS to help users with these.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let&apos;s now figure out the commands that CLI supports for
                  ML

                  BangDB trains models based on the training instructions
                  (metadata) defined in the json format. We can write the
                  metadata in a text editor and save as file and use the file
                  directly to train or we can start a workflow here on the cli
                  which will eventually create the metadata and train the model.
                  Here is the training metadata format which BangDB leverages
                  for training models.
