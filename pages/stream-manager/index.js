                  Stream Manager - Before we go and describe the stream and how
                  do define things and process, let&apos;s just look at the APIs
                  that&apos;s required to do most of the stuff. Now let&apos;s
                  get into the concept of BangDB Stream Manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stream Manager is defined as set of attributes that together
                  form a particular stream event and then operations that can be
                  done on these events. Let&apos;s take an example of very
                  simple case where we have few attributes are coming from
                  different streams. For ex; temp, pressure data stream, etc.
                  for any IOT case. Then we can define the stream as following:

                <p>
                  This is basic structure to define the streams. Let&apos;s
                  discuss more on this.
                </p>
                <h2>Schema</h2>
                <p>
                  Since for any real use case, we will have to deal with more
                  than single stream. Then we need to define the operations that
                  would be done on these streams. Hence we will need to put all
                  these streams and the operations on the stream data in some
                  wrapper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use &quot;schema&quot; as a container for the streams and
                  operations on them. This also allows us to isolate two
                  different schemas within the system. You could also think of
                  schema to segregate based on the different solutions or apps
                  or users within the system, thereby kind of namespace which
                  will ensure sanity across different structures
                </p>
                <h2>Stream</h2>
                <p>
                  This is a collection of attributes for a particular data
                  source. For ex: temperature sensor, payment transaction
                  events, telecom cdr data, pizza order-delivery data etc. This
                  is how we will define a stream in simple way:
                </p>
                <aside className="doc-api-code">
                  <p>
                    <strong>&quot;name&quot;</strong> : stream name, give a name
                    of the stream. DB does name mangling using schema name,
                    hence user doesn&apos;t have to bother about it as long as
                    the stream name is unique within schema.
                  </p>
                </aside>
                <aside className="doc-api-code">
                  <p>
                    <strong>&quot;type&quot;</strong> : type of the stream. Even
                    though we ingest data in a stream, due to various processing
                    of data, we would end up creating many other streams as
                    well. There are following types of streams here, denoted by
                    number.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <code>type = 1</code> means normal direct or raw stream, the
                    one for which we ingest data. This streams gets the data
                    ingested from outside, through agents or any other means.
                    Application simply sends data to this stream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <code>type = 2</code> means filter stream, the stream which
                    gets data based on filter defined in the normal or other
                    stream. Once data is ingested in the raw stream, there we
                    may filter the data based on some condition and send data to
                    this filter stream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <code>type = 3</code> means joined stream, the stream which
                    gets data based on two or more joins of streams. Any two
                    streams can join on some condition and output could be sent
                    to this joined stream.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <code>type = 4</code> means entity stream, the stream which
                    gets data from various streams as long term profile data for
                    the entity for long period of time (or forever). More on
                    this later.

                    <strong>&quot;swsz&quot;</strong> : Size of sliding window.
                    Each of these streams could also reside in a sliding window.
                    This is not tumbling window but a continuous window, which
                    is more appropriate for stream analytics. Tumbling window is
                    restriction and BangDB doesn&apos;t deal with it. The swsz
                    is number of seconds for the sliding window.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We can have as low as 1 sec to as large as many years.
                    However, it&apos;s important to set this properly and not go
                    below a day or hour. For use cases where we wish to analyse
                    in 1 sec or 5 sec or 60 sec or min or hour, we can do that
                    using the processing definition which we will discuss later.
                    This swsz size is for the raw stream data and how long would
                    user like to persist it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once it slides, data could be archived or simply discarded
                    or sent to other integrated system. We will have more
                    discussion on this later. Default value for the size is
                    86400 i.e. one day.
