                <p>BangDB works in three different ways:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Embedded</strong> - BangDB is part of application
                    process. On server or device
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Server</strong> - BangDB runs as a service and
                    clients connect to it. User applications use client libs.
                    This is Master - Slave model
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Distributed</strong> - BangDB runs as a p2p based
                    cluster. There is no master or slave, and entire cluster is
                    part of virtual network overlay Replication in this context
                    is for option 2, when server runs in master slave model.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  There is always a single master and there could be one or more
                  slaves attached to it. All the writes (from clients) will
                  happen on master and it will sync data with slaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Replication to the slaves happen in sync /async fashion based
                  on setting and the replica (slaves) can be added at run time
                  without bringing the master to halt and all operations on the
                  server can continue while initial sync and replication is in
                  progress.
                  <br />
                  Below are the list of all supported commands for replication
                  on CLI
                </p>

                <p>Make a server running at ip:port as master</p>

                <p>
                  Make a server running at ip:port as slave to a master running
                  at some other ip:port
