                <p>
                  Let&apos;s look at few more use cases for CEP. You would
                  notice that it&apos;s pretty hard (or next to impossible) for
                  SQL or RDBMS or other stream processing systems to handle some
                  of these.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 1</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose we want to match pairs of stock quotes, where the
                  first is an IBM quote with a price above $83 and the second is
                  the next Microsoft quote to appear in the stream.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 2</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose we want to match pairs of stock quotes, where the
                  first is an IBM quote with a price above $83 and the second is
                  the next quote (of any stock) with a price above the IBM price
                  from the first quote.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 3</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose we want to find a monotonically increasing temperature
                  readings for a set of sensors, where the run lasts for at
                  least 10 readings, and the first reading is greater than 78C.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 4</h3>
                <p>
                  Find anomalies in pressure vessel where the pressure readings
                  are continuously more than average value of last 1 hour
                  readings and this is repeated for 10 such readings along with
                  pressure value increasing continuously at the same time within
                  1000 seconds.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 5</h3>
                <p>
                  Find patterns where more than one credit card transactions
                  happen from two different locations within 1000 seconds for
                  the same credit card by swiping.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 6</h3>
                <p>
                  Find the pattern where CDR records show different cell tower
                  for same number within 1000 seconds where the towers are more
                  than 25 km apart.
                </p>
                <h3>Example 7</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose we wish to find a scenario where individual
                  temperature and pressure readings are within limit but both
                  are increasing continuously for 10 such readings within 1000
                  seconds with temperature more than 68 C and pressure 5 ATM.
                </p>
                <aside className="doc-note">
                  <strong>Note: </strong>Here we need to join the two streams
                  namely temperature and pressure].
                </aside>
                <h3>Example 8</h3>
                <p>
                  The standard deviation of sensor reading is continuously out
                  of 2 SIGMA in normal gaussian distribution for 10 readings
                  within 1000 seconds with deviation increasing continuously.
