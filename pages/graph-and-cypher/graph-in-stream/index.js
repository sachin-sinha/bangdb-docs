          <p>
            BangDB streams can also use Graph for the events which are
            time-series data. To use Graph in the stream, we may simply edit the
            schema and add set of relations as needed.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Let&apos;s say we have a schema where we receive purchase events for
            e-commerce and we would like to link user and the product he/she
            purchases, then we would simply add following:
          </p>
          <HighlightedJava
            code={`"rels":[{"sub":"user","obj":"product","rel":"BUYS"}]`}
          />
          <p>Here is the short schema definition for example:</p>
          <HighlightedJava
            code={`{
   "schema":"grpahschema",
   "streams":[
      {
         "name":"order",
         "type":1,
         "swsz":86400,
         "inpt":[
            
         ],
         "attr":[
            {
               "name":"product",
               "type":"STRING",
               "sidx":1,
               "kysz":32,
               "stat":"UCOUNT"
            },
            {
               "name":"user",
               "type":"STRING",
               "sidx":1,
               "stat":"UCOUNT"
            }
         ],
         "rels":[
            {
               "sub":"user",
               "obj":"product",
               "rel":"BUYS"
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}`}
          />
          <p>
            That&apos;s it, where the &quot;user&quot; and &quot;product&quot;
            are attributes in the Order stream. Once defined, db would simply
            keep creating the relations (and creating nodes as required).
          </p>
          <p>
            To query, we can use Cypher as described above using usual methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let&apos;s look at some of the topics in detail and in advance
            sense, also we will introduce SYMM, ASYMM, AGGREGATION in detail,
            Filtering in detail, SHORT_PATH and ALL_PATH in more complex
            situations and SIMILARITY.
          </p>
