          Difference between cypher used by BangDB vs Neo4j
        </h1>
        <div className="article-body">
          <p>Following are basic differences from Cypher point of view:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For all queries (retrieval), the query starts with
              &quot;&lt;token&gt;=&gt;&quot;, instead of &quot;Match&quot;
            </li>
            <li>
              The queries could be nested using the &quot;[]&quot; bracket which
              becomes subject for subsequent nodes. For example, look at
              following two queries.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <HighlightedJava
            code={`S2=>[S1=>(Person:*)-[ACTED_IN]->(Movie:*)]-[LIVES_IN]->(City:Bangalore)`}
          />
          <HighlightedJava
            code={`S1=>(Person:*)-[ACTED_IN]->(Movie:*)-[DIRECTED_BY]->(Person:*)-[LIVES_IN]->(City:SFO)`}
          />
          <p>
            First one will first fetch all the persons who have acted in any
            movies, and who lives in city Bangalore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second one will fetch all the persons who live in &quot;SFO&quot;
            who have directed movies in which some persons have acted in etcâ€¦
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Specific methods like; #ALL_PATH, #SHORT_PATH, #ALL_NODE is
              supported to find all paths between any two nodes, shortest path
              between two nodes and all nodes in between two nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here we use &quot;label:name&quot; instead of
              &quot;name&quot;:&quot;label&quot; as in Cypher. This is mainly
              because it&apos;s more intuitive to use labels first and then
              name. If we wish to take any name, we can put &apos;*&apos; in
              place of it. In-fact we can put &apos;*&apos; for label or
              relation as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              The variable or alias begins with&apos;@&apos;, like (@p
              Person:Sachin) etc. This is handy for selection of
              attributes/properties from a node or relation
            </li>
            <li>
              All data science or ML related activities can be done using the
              Keywords like &quot;SIMILARITY&quot;, &quot;CLUSTER&quot;,
              &quot;CENTRALITY&quot;, &quot;COMMUNITY_DETECTION&quot;,
              &quot;GROUPS&quot; to leverage inbuilt dedicated ML+Graph
              processing. However, we can bring the entire ML algos to Graph by
              simply using &quot;ML_ALGO&quot; keyword along with the
              model&apos;s name that is trained within BangDB.
